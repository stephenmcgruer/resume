résumé
======

This, you may be surprised to know, is my résumé. To see it in action,
visit [it on my website](http://stephenmcgruer.com/resume).

Building
--------

On a linux system, install the following (and their dependencies):

* lmodern
* texlive
* texlive-base
* texlive-binaries
* texlive-fonts-extra
* texlive-fonts-recommended
* texlive-generic-recommended
* texlive-latex-base
* texlive-xetex

In addition, this resume requires Geo Sans Light installed; I am not aware of
any package for this so I just download and install it manually.

Then run:

xelatex resume.tex

The output will be in resume.pdf

Acknowledgements
----------------

The latex version of this résumé is based extensively on the awesome résumé of
[Jarrell Waggoner](https://github.com/malloc47/cv).
